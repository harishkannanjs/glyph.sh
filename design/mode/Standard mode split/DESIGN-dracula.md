# DESIGN-dracula.md — Dracula theme

> Uses the **Standard mode** UI language from `DESIGN.md` §1B — NOT the
> TUI language from §1, which is reserved for the Blogly signature theme
> only. This means ordinary rounded sliding toggles (not bracketed `[ Y ]`/
> `[ N ]`), rounded cards and buttons, a normal tab bar, and no box-drawing
> panel borders, status bar, or blinking-cursor treatment anywhere in the
> product while this theme is active.
> This file defines only the Dracula palette and font. **The light variant
> below is Blogly's own design** — Dracula has no official light palette;
> this was built by inverting Dracula's own background/foreground roles
> and darkening its accents for contrast, rather than inventing new colors.

**Mood**: vibrant, playful, a little gothic — the most saturated and
high-energy theme in the set. Purple/pink/cyan/green all appear at real
strength; this is the one theme where "one accent used sparingly" bends
slightly, since Dracula's identity is built on multiple vivid accents
working together (syntax-highlighting-style), not a single restrained one.

**Font**: Fira Code — ligature support suits Dracula's long history as a
programmer-editor theme.
