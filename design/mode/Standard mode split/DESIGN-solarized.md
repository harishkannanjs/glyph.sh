# DESIGN-solarized.md — Solarized theme

> Uses the **Standard mode** UI language from `DESIGN.md` §1B — NOT the
> TUI language from §1, which is reserved for the Blogly signature theme
> only. This means ordinary rounded sliding toggles (not bracketed `[ Y ]`/
> `[ N ]`), rounded cards and buttons, a normal tab bar, and no box-drawing
> panel borders, status bar, or blinking-cursor treatment anywhere in the
> product while this theme is active.
> This file defines only the Solarized palette and font.

**Mood**: calm, low-contrast-by-design, scientifically engineered for
eye comfort over long reading sessions (Solarized's entire premise — its
values were tuned using CIELAB lightness math, not chosen by eye). This
theme should feel the least "punchy" of the set on purpose — do not
increase contrast beyond spec to make it look more "modern."

**Font**: Source Code Pro — a neutral, precise monospace that doesn't
compete with Solarized's own carefully engineered subtlety.

**Note**: unlike every other theme in this set, Solarized dark and light
share the same accent hue exactly — that's correct, not an oversight; it's
core to the palette's identity.
