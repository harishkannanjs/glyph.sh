# DESIGN-tokyo-night.md — Tokyo Night theme

> Uses the **Standard mode** UI language from `DESIGN.md` §1B — NOT the
> TUI language from §1, which is reserved for the Blogly signature theme
> only. This means ordinary rounded sliding toggles (not bracketed `[ Y ]`/
> `[ N ]`), rounded cards and buttons, a normal tab bar, and no box-drawing
> panel borders, status bar, or blinking-cursor treatment anywhere in the
> product while this theme is active.
> This file defines only the Tokyo Night palette and font.

**Mood**: neon-nocturnal, city-at-night — cool blue-purple base with
vivid, slightly electric accent colors. The most "cyberpunk" of the
available themes; leans into it rather than softening it.

**Font**: Cascadia Code (its ligature-friendly, slightly technical
character suits Tokyo Night's coder-at-night identity).

**Signature touch**: since Tokyo Night's whole identity is "city lights
against a dark sky," the primary toggle-ON fill and active-tab indicator
should use the slightly more saturated `#7dcfff` (cyan) rather than the
base accent, for a touch more neon presence in exactly those two spots —
everywhere else, use `read.accent` as normal.
