# DESIGN-catppuccin.md — Catppuccin theme

> Uses the **Standard mode** UI language from `DESIGN.md` §1B — NOT the
> TUI language from §1, which is reserved for the Blogly signature theme
> only. This means ordinary rounded sliding toggles (not bracketed `[ Y ]`/
> `[ N ]`), rounded cards and buttons, a normal tab bar, and no box-drawing
> panel borders, status bar, or blinking-cursor treatment anywhere in the
> product while this theme is active. This file defines only the
> Catppuccin palette and font applied to that same Standard-mode shell.

**Mood**: soft, cozy, pastel — the most "warm and inviting" of the
available themes, without sacrificing the terminal structure underneath.
Selecting it should make the same dashboard feel gentler, not different in
kind.

**Font**: JetBrains Mono (Catppuccin's own ecosystem is built around
clean, humanist monospace fonts — Monocraft's blocky pixel style would
clash with its soft palette).

**Toggle and active-tab fill**: rendered in `read.accent` on both modes —
the soft periwinkle blue (Mocha) / saturated blue (Latte) should read as
calm rather than alarming, consistent with the palette's overall
character.
