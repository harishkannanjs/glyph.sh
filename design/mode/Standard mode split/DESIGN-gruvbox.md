# DESIGN-gruvbox.md — Gruvbox theme

> Uses the **Standard mode** UI language from `DESIGN.md` §1B — NOT the
> TUI language from §1, which is reserved for the Blogly signature theme
> only. This means ordinary rounded sliding toggles (not bracketed `[ Y ]`/
> `[ N ]`), rounded cards and buttons, a normal tab bar, and no box-drawing
> panel borders, status bar, or blinking-cursor treatment anywhere in the
> product while this theme is active.
> This file defines only the Gruvbox palette and font.

**Mood**: warm, earthy, retro — low-saturation ochres and rust tones
against a warm (not blue-tinted) near-black or cream background. Should
feel like a well-worn terminal setup, not a "modern SaaS dark mode."

**Font**: IBM Plex Mono — a warmer, more humanist monospace than
JetBrains Mono, matching Gruvbox's retro character.

**Note**: Gruvbox's background is warm-toned (slightly brown/olive-black),
not neutral — do not let any implementation default the background to a
neutral or blue-black gray, which would read as "wrong" to anyone who
already uses Gruvbox elsewhere.
